"""

Corrections made:
1. Removed debug print statement that revealed the secret number.
2. Added single-line comments to explain each part of the code.
3. Ensured input validation checks if the user enters exactly a 4-digit number.
4. Used f-strings for better string formatting.



Explanation of Changes:
1. compare_numbers function:

This function now checks each digit in the guessed number (user_guess) against the actual number (number).
It counts "bulls" when the guessed digit is in the correct position and "cows" when the guessed digit is in the number but in the wrong position.
It returns a tuple with the count of cows and bulls.
2. Game Instructions:

The instructions are printed at the beginning to explain how the game works.
3. Input Handling:

raw_input() was replaced with input(), which is used in Python 3.
Thereâ€™s a check to ensure the user inputs a valid 4-digit number (len(user_guess) != 4 or not user_guess.isdigit()).
4. Exit Option:

The user can type "exit" at any prompt to end the game.
5. Padding the Number:


How the Game Works:
The player guesses a 4-digit number.
The program compares the guess to the hidden number and provides feedback:
Bulls: Digits in the correct position.
Cows: Digits in the wrong position.
The game continues until the player guesses all four digits correctly (4 bulls), and then the game ends.
